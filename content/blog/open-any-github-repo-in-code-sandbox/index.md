If you are someone who wants to _quickly just lookup some code in a GitHub repository_ or even fork or edit it, then this is a good **handy trick** to know.

> NOTE: If you are not a PRO member of **codesandbox** then the trick will work only on _Public repositories_

Steps to follow (if the GIF doesn't sum it up ðŸ˜œ):

**STEP 1:** Open any _Public_ GitHub repository.
**STEP 2:** Go to the URL and append 'box' to your github.com URL in-between 'hub' and '.com' and it will redirect to CodeSandbox.

Here's an example:

```
Change the GitHub URL:
https://github.com/bhatvikrant/react-thumbnail-player

To:
https://githubbox.com/bhatvikrant/react-thumbnail-player
```

And that's all you have to do!
